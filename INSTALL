In order to install ~gitto~, just run:

: make install

This will install ~gitto~ to ~/usr/local/~, if you would like to install
it somewhere else you can use the =DESTDIR= variable:

: make install DESTDIR=/some/other/place

This will install ~gitto~ to =/some/other/place/=.

* Packages

  - There is also a [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gitto-git/][package]] in the [[http://aur.archlinux.org][Archlinux User Repository]], which
    installs the latest git checkout.

* Requirements

  ~gitto~ requires [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] version 2.0.9 or newer to be available.

* Removal

  If you're fed up with ~gitto~ and want it gone you can run:

  : make uninstall

  This will remove any ~gitto~ installed files from ~/usr/local/~. If you
  used the =DESTDIR= variable during installation, you should give it
  the same value here, like:

  : make uninstall DESTDIR=/some/other/place

  This will remove any ~gitto~ installed files from ~/some/other/place/~.
