If you wish to contribute you can use either the sources located on
[[http://code.ryuslash.org/cgit.cgi/gitto/][ryuslash.org]] or the [[https://github.com/ryuslash/gitto][github]] sources.

* Getting the source

  If you wish to work on ~gitto~ you can get the sources by cloning the
  repository:

  : git clone git://ryusalsh.org/git-auto-commit-mode.git

* Style

  Use spaces, don't use tabs. If you can, keep lines shorter than 80
  characters. Other than that, Emacs can handle indentation pretty
  well. [[http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/][Geiser]] can help too, if you're using Emacs.

* Patches

  If you want to send any patches I prefer an email with the output
  generated by =git request-pull=, possibly with =-p=, over things like
  github pull requests, but nothing will be turned away.
